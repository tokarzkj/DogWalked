# Goal
The objective was build a very simple game and understand the features of GameMaker.

## The Game
The game itself is inspired by my dog, who is a reactive walker. In this game, you have a dog that is easily distracted when you take him on walks. If you aren't careful he will drag you while chasing a critter up a tree. The actual gameloop
could use improvement, but essentially the only objective in this game is to find a couple of lost puppies and return them to the dog park.
